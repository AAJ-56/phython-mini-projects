## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains my *Python learning journey* — from writing the first “Hello World” to building *portfolio-worthy mini-projects*.  
It’s designed not just for practice, but also to become a *reference hub* for anyone learning Python from scratch.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Master Python basics with clean, readable code  
2. Build *modular, reusable scripts* for real-world use  
3. Document every step with *clear commit history*  
4. Gradually transition into automation & data analysis projects
